Ideal Job

(https://boards.greenhouse.io/twitch/jobs/4727175002)
The Senior Creative Strategist does the company's overall work, for example, choosing advertisement, the biggest source of revenue from Twitch. But the most attractive thing is that you can draw up a joint business plan on Twitch.
The skills required by this position require creative thinking skills with more than five years of experience working for other creative teams.
There are many things I can get from joining this company called Twitch, but the only ability I have to get into that company is creative thinking.
I will learn the skills of IT through the regular curriculum of RMIT and get a job in a YouTube-related company after graduation. After I get a job at the company, I will work on responding to customers and developing apps. After creating a five-year career, I will get a job at Twitch.
